Background Information

The management of a certain NGO Hospital would like to have a product developed that
would make predictions on whether a person has diabetics or not.
The data were collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several
constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In
particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (a subgroup of Native
Americans) and are females of ages 21 and above.

Problem Statement

Your task for this project will be to perform univariate and bivariate analysis in an effort to
prepare your data for modeling in the later stages.
